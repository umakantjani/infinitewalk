					<h3>1. HIRE FOR ATTITUDE THAN APTITUDE</h3>
                  	<blockquote>
						<p>"In looking for someone to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. But the most important is integrity, because if they don't have that, the other two qualities, intelligence and energy, are going to kill you." —Warren Buffett</p>
                  	</blockquote>
					<p>I have always valued attitude of a person far much higher than her aptitude. Because you will and always can change a person's aptitude but attitude. A person with low aptitude but high attitude can and will always work hard to find a way to learn and deliver. But a person with high aptitude but bad attitude will always find a better reason to let you down.</p>
					<h3>2. ALWAYS HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE SMARTER THAN YOU</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"The project manager who is the smartest man on his project has done a lousy job of recruitment." —Jerry Madden</p>
                  	</blockquote>
					<p>There is this popular saying, “You are the average of five persons around you.”Therefore I suggest you to be cautious in choosing peoples around you. A smart employee with integrity never lets you down. Because he believes in the concept of king maker but not in being the king. He believes in doing something great for others. He always has respect for the commitment and good work.</p>
					<p>After all a smart employee makes your work easier and a dumb employee increases your workload.</p>
					<h3>3. GET OUT OF THEIR WAY</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"It does’t not make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do." —Steve Jobs</p>
                  	</blockquote>
					<p>Thats true, it’s not smart to tell smart people what to do. When you’ve hired a smart employee, your only job is to get out of her way and let her help you in her own way. Just give them the task and trust in their decisions; provide them full autonomy. When they go wrong; somewhere quote them from your experience and don’t punish for their mistake.</p>
					<p>Always back-up your employee. Let her feel that hiring her was your smartest move and you will be behind her every time she needs you.</p>
