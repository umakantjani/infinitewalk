# Don’t Get Distracted by the City
#### Israel Shaw

Don’t get distracted by the city. We lie beneath stars. 
The thought makes me honest. 
We fall in circles  
through a billion galaxies, 
hanging in fragile orbit. 
Is my signi"cance an illusion? 
Is all purpose forgotten? 
The darkness makes me  
listen - desperately listen - 
for a sound 
that would quiet the panic  
in my heart beat. 
A noise, 
A voice, 
It came. 
It always does. 
Don’t get distracted by the city.
