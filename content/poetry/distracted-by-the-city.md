I met <a href="https://israelshaw.com" target="_blank">Israel Shaw</a> in a BBQ party in New York City through a mutual friend of mine, <a href="http://arichjourney.com/" target="_blank">Anthony</a>. Hours into conversation he showed me one of his poems, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfFJYitlzf6/?taken-by=israel.shaw" target="_blank">'Don't Get Distracted by the City'</a>. His poem got my attention, especially those two lines in which he writes insignificant of us in this vast universe: We fall in circles through a billion galaxies, hanging in a fragile orbit. Part of which connects to my previous post of [Journey Wisely](/poetry/journey-wisely/).
