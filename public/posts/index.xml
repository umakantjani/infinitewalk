      <description>It is a time of transition for we all, it&amp;rsquo;s always been. We all see transitions in different ways, we see time differently as well. The online Oxford Dictionary describes transition as the process or period of changing from one stage or condition to another and also describes change as the ability to make or become different. Wherever you are and whatever you&amp;rsquo;re doing, as you read it if you&amp;rsquo;re not in a comfort zone and with a passive posture about everything around you chances are that you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing some sort of change.</description>

      <description>Whenever my work struggles to inspire me I switch last few hours of my evening to read something funny or inspiring quotes from Goodreads/Medium. Today, my way back to New York, I started reading an article on Medium.
Now, there you go my favorite quotes of Marshall McLuhan.
 &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.&amp;rdquo; —Author Unknown.
&amp;ldquo;Every society honors its live conformists and its dead troublemakers.</description>

Top executives spend upwards of 18 hours per week - third of their working week - in meetings. Estimated 25-50% of meeting time considered wasted Research shows the cost of Unnecessary meeting to Business in terms of wasted salary hours as $37 Billion.</description>

 Recently, few of my friends recommended a TV show named &amp;ldquo;SUITS&amp;rdquo; to watch; they even shared the entire four seasons. Taking benefits of free times in my traveling schedule I tried to watch a few, and it became so addictive that I had finished the whole 4 seasons in few weeks.</description>

      <description>My Tribe — business travelers, the technophiles, the Internet enthusiasts, the the conference-speakers — are thrilled about Uber. Whenever I need to take a ride, I touch that icon on my iPhone — the one with the logo of a superhero, and within few minutes appears a car with a well civilized driver.
uber Uber — convenience of reaching anywhere.
Don’t get me wrong. For all the reasons I like Uber, for equally same reasons I love public transport as well (in few cities in India like Bangalore and Delhi).</description>

      <description>1. HIRE FOR ATTITUDE THAN APTITUDE  &amp;ldquo;In looking for someone to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. But the most important is integrity, because if they don&amp;rsquo;t have that, the other two qualities, intelligence and energy, are going to kill you.&amp;rdquo; —Warren Buffett
 I have always valued attitude of a person far much higher than her aptitude. Because you will and always can change a person&amp;rsquo;s aptitude but attitude.</description>
