      <description>I do agree with Elle. No matter how stubborn we are, sometimes the world won&amp;rsquo;t just wheel on our terms. We can&amp;rsquo;t always say, &amp;ldquo;its my way or highway&amp;rdquo;. Its not all or nothing all the time. There are times when we need to compromise.

      <description>I love this line a lot. Because confidence has been something I used to struggle with. Once, a friend of mine once told me, my confidence is not that they will like me, my confidence is, I will be fine even if they don&amp;rsquo;t.

      <title>For Tom Shaw S.S.J.E. (1945-2014)</title>

      <description>As you might have realized, Mary Oliver and her poems has great impact on me. Especially this one from &amp;ldquo;Felicity&amp;rdquo; reminds me of the loss of a great fried who used to love me to space and beyond. I had called her weeks before she passed away and told her, &amp;ldquo;Meet me for Lunch in New York City, I have a good news for you&amp;rdquo;. The week I was about to meet her, I got the saddest news that she passed away.</description>

      <description>I would definitely say this, &amp;lsquo;Mary Oliver is one of my favorite contemporary poets&amp;rsquo;. She has a way of romanticizing with mother nature. She is an “indefatigable guide to the natural world”. Her poems make me feel humanity. This poem from her Pulitzer prize winning poetry book &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Mornings&amp;rdquo; shows how we should live like trees, by not letting external things affect us, the way trees go through so much of events with change in seasons and storms.</description>

      <title>If There is Something to Desire, there will be something to regret</title>

      <description>These lines are important to me. Most often or not, I find myself in a position where I say yes to things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. And I learnt the hard way that, when you&amp;rsquo;re saying &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to someone, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to yourself.

      <title>In The Midst of Winter</title>

      <description>This poem has been one of my favorite all along. This tells us that the outside negativity has lesser impact than what lays inside. We are stronger than our fears. Greater than our limits. There is a light inside us that keeps us awake in the moment of darkness.

      <description>My mentor &amp;amp; partner-in-crime Shree Pragada, one of best human beings to talk to about existence of this world, metaphysical literature, and the God, often tells me, &amp;ldquo;this world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need our help. we are here to serve a purpose. We have got this one life to realize that one purpose, and fulfill it. This world is perfect just the way it is.&amp;rdquo; It made me realize we are insignificant in this universe.</description>

      <description>I think this single line has more gravity than the core of universe. Mary Oliver beautifully pens down how sometimes what we think as our limitation is our strongest source power.

      <description>Sometimes, I think life is just this, and nothing else. There is no certainty, there is no pre-determined rules. Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a operating manual. And all five lives from Albert Camus says it all.

      <description>Well, there are two kinds of people in this world; those who believe God, and those who don&amp;rsquo;t. Strangely, I am neither of them. However, this prose makes me debate with myself; which group I would like to belongs to?

      <title>Don&#39;t Get Distracted by the City</title>

      <description>I met Israel Shaw in a BBQ party in New York City through a mutual friend of mine, Anthony. Hours into conversation he showed me one of his poems, &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Get Distracted by the City&amp;rsquo;. His poem got my attention, especially those two lines in which he writes insignificant of us in this vast universe: We fall in circles through a billion galaxies, hanging in a fragile orbit. Part of which connects to my previous post of Journey Wisely.</description>

      <description>This one spots to the division and non-symmetry we have in our society as this point. We need to remind ourselves that we are all one and we need to love each other. Have we forgotten the rules of our existence today?
