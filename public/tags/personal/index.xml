      <description>My mentor &amp;amp; partner-in-crime Shree Pragada, one of best human beings to talk to about existence of this world, metaphysical literature, and the God, often tells me, &amp;ldquo;this world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need our help. we are here to serve a purpose. We have got this one life to realize that one purpose, and fulfill it. This world is perfect just the way it is.&amp;rdquo; It made me realize we are insignificant in this universe.</description>
