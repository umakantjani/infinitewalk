      <description>It is a time of transition for we all, it&amp;rsquo;s always been. We all see transitions in different ways, we see time differently as well. The online Oxford Dictionary describes transition as the process or period of changing from one stage or condition to another and also describes change as the ability to make or become different. Wherever you are and whatever you&amp;rsquo;re doing, as you read it if you&amp;rsquo;re not in a comfort zone and with a passive posture about everything around you chances are that you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing some sort of change.</description>
