As you might have realized, Mary Oliver and her poems has great impact on me. Especially this one from <a href="http://a.co/btmOKQB" target="_blank">"Felicity"</a> reminds me of the loss of a great fried who used to love me to space and beyond. I had called her weeks before she passed away and told her, *"Meet me for Lunch in New York City, I have a good news for you".* The week I was about to meet her, I got the saddest news that she passed away. I know this feeling. I know this coldness. May almighty God bless her soul.
