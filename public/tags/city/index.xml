      <description>I met Israel Shaw in a BBQ party in New York City through a mutual friend of mine, Anthony. Hours into conversation he showed me one of his poems, &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Get Distracted by the City&amp;rsquo;. His poem got my attention, especially those two lines in which he writes insignificant of us in this vast universe: We fall in circles through a billion galaxies, hanging in a fragile orbit. Part of which connects to my previous post of Journey Wisely.</description>
