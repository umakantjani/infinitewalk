Whenever my work struggles to inspire me I switch last few hours of my evening to read something funny or inspiring quotes from Goodreads/Medium. Today, my way back to New York, I started reading an article on Medium.

Now, there you go my favorite quotes of Marshall McLuhan.

> "If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice." —Author Unknown.    

> "Every society honors its live conformists and its dead troublemakers."  

> "We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us."  

> "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is a hallucinating idiot...for he sees what no one else does: things that, to everyone else, are not there."  

> "A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding."

> "One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in."

> "The medium is the message."

> "Many a good argument is ruined by some fool who knows what he is talking about."

> "Most of our assumptions have outlined their uselessness."

> "We don't know who discovered water, but we know it wasn't the fish."

> "Our technology forces us to live mythically."

> "The only people who have proof of their sanity are those who have been discharged from mental institutions"

> "Our permanent address is tomorrow."

> "I am resolutely opposed to all innovation, all change, but I am determined to understand what’s happening. Because I don’t choose just to sit and let the juggernaut roll over me. Many people seem to think that if you talk about something recent, you’re in favor of it. The exact opposite is true in my case. Anything I talk about is almost certainly something I’m resolutely against. And it seems to me the best way to oppose it is to understand it. And then you know where to turn off the buttons."

> "I am an intellectual thug who has been slowly accumulating a private arsenal with every intention of using it. In a mindless age, every insight takes on the character of a lethal weapon. Every man of goodwill is the enemy of society."

> "Someone asked me if I really believed there was life after death. I replied: Do you really believe there is any life before death?"

> "Some days, I wish the whole fucking world would just 'phone in sick."

> "To see a man slip on a banana skin is to see a rationally structured system suddenly translated into a whirling machine."

> "If it works it's obsolete"

> "The greatest discovery of the 21st century will be the discovery that Man was not meant to live at the speed of light."

> "Playboy: Have you ever taken LSD yourself? McLUHAN: No, I never have. I'm an observer in these matters, not a participant."

> "A typewriter is a means of transcribing thought, not expressing it."

> "A light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."

Hope you are feeling better now.
