      <description>As you might have realized, Mary Oliver and her poems has great impact on me. Especially this one from &amp;ldquo;Felicity&amp;rdquo; reminds me of the loss of a great fried who used to love me to space and beyond. I had called her weeks before she passed away and told her, &amp;ldquo;Meet me for Lunch in New York City, I have a good news for you&amp;rdquo;. The week I was about to meet her, I got the saddest news that she passed away.</description>

      <description>I would definitely say this, &amp;lsquo;Mary Oliver is one of my favorite contemporary poets&amp;rsquo;. She has a way of romanticizing with mother nature. She is an “indefatigable guide to the natural world”. Her poems make me feel humanity. This poem from her Pulitzer prize winning poetry book &amp;ldquo;A Thousand Mornings&amp;rdquo; shows how we should live like trees, by not letting external things affect us, the way trees go through so much of events with change in seasons and storms.</description>

      <description>This poem has been one of my favorite all along. This tells us that the outside negativity has lesser impact than what lays inside. We are stronger than our fears. Greater than our limits. There is a light inside us that keeps us awake in the moment of darkness.

      <description>I think this single line has more gravity than the core of universe. Mary Oliver beautifully pens down how sometimes what we think as our limitation is our strongest source power.
