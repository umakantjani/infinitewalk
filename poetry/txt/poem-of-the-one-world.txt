# Poem of the one world
#### Mary Oliver

This morning
The beautiful white heron
Was floating along above the water

And then into the sky of this 
The one world
We all belong to

Where everything 
Sooner or later 
is apart of everything else

Which thought made me feel 
for a while
Quite beautiful myself.
