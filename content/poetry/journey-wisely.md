My mentor & partner-in-crime <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Shree-Pragada" target="_blank">Shree Pragada</a>, one of best human beings to talk to about existence of this world, metaphysical literature, and the God, often tells me, *"this world doesn't need our help. we are here to serve a purpose. We have got this one life to realize that one purpose, and fulfill it. This world is perfect just the way it is."* It made me realize we are insignificant in this universe. We need to live and let other live. People are going to do what they are going to do, only thing a man can do is control his own actions. We all are given with same 24 hours in a day, what we do with that is the value we bring to this world. As I found myself telling my manager once, *"we don't pay our employees for how many hours they work, we pay them for the value bring to the hours."*
