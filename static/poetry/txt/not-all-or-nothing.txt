# Not All Or Nothing
#### By Alexandra Elle

You have to learn to be flexible or you will break. It’s not all or nothing every single time. 

My greatest lesson in leaning flexibility is this:

You shouldn’t hold other people accountable for how someone else has treated you in the past. Cherish your relationships and build trust by communicating open and honestly. 

Don’t ruin great things because you’re stuck on how things were or are with other people in your life. 

Everyone is not the same or out to hurt you. 

Be flexible or prepare to break in half.
