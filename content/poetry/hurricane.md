I would definitely say this, '<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-oliver" target="_blank">Mary Oliver</a> is one of my favorite contemporary poets'. She has a way of romanticizing with mother nature. She is an “indefatigable guide to the natural world”. Her poems make me feel humanity. This poem from her Pulitzer prize winning poetry book <a href="http://a.co/9z9oqUL" target="_blank">"A Thousand Mornings"</a> shows how we should live like trees, by not letting external things affect us, the way trees go through so much of events with change in seasons and storms. However, when the season passes it seems as if they don't even care about the storm. Life just goes on.
