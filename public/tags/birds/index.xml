      <description>As you might have realized, Mary Oliver and her poems has great impact on me. Especially this one from &amp;ldquo;Felicity&amp;rdquo; reminds me of the loss of a great fried who used to love me to space and beyond. I had called her weeks before she passed away and told her, &amp;ldquo;Meet me for Lunch in New York City, I have a good news for you&amp;rdquo;. The week I was about to meet her, I got the saddest news that she passed away.</description>

      <description>I think this single line has more gravity than the core of universe. Mary Oliver beautifully pens down how sometimes what we think as our limitation is our strongest source power.
